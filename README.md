# GameCredits

This repo contains the latest version of GameCredits.

GameCredits has been ported to the newest Pfennig code base, which is equivalent to Bitcoin 0.9.4 adapted to Scrypt and KGW.

This version of GameCredits is fully tested on all platforms, downloads can be found by clicking the releases tab.

Please upgrade to keep the network secure, and your client functioning.

Post Fork GameCredits 0.8.4+ will co-operate with the new GameCredits 0.9.4, but SHOULD be upgraded.
Pre Fork GameCredits/GamersCoin 0.8.3 and earlier MUST be upgraded to successfully join the GMC network.
